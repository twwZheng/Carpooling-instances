# Carpooling-instances
Data used for simulation in paper titled - Driver-Rider Matching and Route Optimization in Carpooling Service for Delivering Intercity Commuters to the High-speed Railway Station.
The dataset contains a set of carpooling instances for four commuter scales. Each file in the dataset is described as follow:
(1) Index: index of nodes. 
(2) x: horizontal coordinates of nodes.
(3) y: vertical coordinates of nodes. 
(4) EA: earliest arrival time for commuters.
(5) LA: latest arrival time for commuters. 
(6) CN: commuters with or without a car. 
(7) Capa: vehicle capacity. 
(8) Î´: flexible time coefficient.
(9) RN: random number of time-window lengths. 
(10) TWL: time-window lengths.
